# eRParranger
A bacterial contig rearrangement system in genomic structure based on replication profiling

## Introduction 
This is a software to rearrange

## Preparation
This program does not require other modules. On the other hand, users should prepare two files (assembled contig file and read mapping file).
The assembled contig file can be obtained from SPAdes program (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades).
The sequence reads mapped SAM file on SPAdes contig can be generated by BWA program (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net).
